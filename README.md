JAMM Peak Finder
======

**JAMM is a peak finder for NGS datasets (ChIP-Seq, ATAC-Seq, DNase-Seq..etc.) that can integrate replicates and assign peak boundaries accurately. JAMM is applicable to both broad and narrow datasets. Read more [in JAMM's publication](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/09/15/bioinformatics.btu568).** 

JAMM was developed at the [Ohler lab](http://ohlerlab.mdc-berlin.net/) at [BIMSB-MDC](http://www.mdc-berlin.de/13800178/en/bimsb) in Berlin.

News and Updates
------

* **Jul 30 2015:** *New version of JAMM released (v1.0.7rev2)*. This version has some minor bug fixes and some cryptic errors replaced by user-friendly messages.

* **Feb 18 2015:** *New version of JAMM released (v1.0.7rev1)*. This version introduces clustering model initialization options among other things, optional PCR duplicates filtering and reports the seed used for all randomization/sampling steps.

* **Jan 14 2015:** New questions and answers have been added to the [https://code.google.com/p/jamm-peak-finder/wiki/FAQs FAQs wiki page]. Why does JAMM output a large number of peaks? What is the "filtered" list?...Those questions and more are answered in the [https://code.google.com/p/jamm-peak-finder/wiki/FAQs FAQs wiki page]!

* **Dec 06 2014:** *New version of JAMM released (v1.0.6rev3)*. This version fixes a bug related to bash localization that affects peak score sorting for some users. You can read more in the changelog. 

* **Nov 25 2014:** *New version of JAMM released (v1.0.6rev2)*. This version fixes bugs in the previous released version JAMMv1.0.6rev1, that cause paired-end option to not function.

* **Nov 11 2014:** *New version of JAMM released (v1.0.6rev1)*. This version has two main changes: *NO dependencies on "sqldf" R package*, and _optional_ window fold enrichment cutoff to reduce running time and get only more highly confident peaks.

* **Nov 11 2014:** After a recent R update, certain versions of some R packages are not compatible with certain versions of the "sqldf" R package. This affects all JAMM versions from v1.0.4 until v1.0.6. Starting v1.0.6rev1, JAMM has NO dependencies on "sqldf" package.

Example Dataset
------

*You can use [this small dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8nxBVNVchN9cFFzQnQxMnNQUjQ/edit?usp=sharing) to test if JAMM is installed correctly. Installation instructions above!*

This dataset is chromosome 21, in K562 CTCF ChIP-Seq from [ENCODE](https://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/).


Quick Tutorial
------

Before going ahead with this tutorial, please make sure JAMM is running properly on your machine using the small dataset provided above.

The purpose of this tutorial is to help you get started with running JAMM. The tutorial uses ENCODE (Broad Institute) H3K27ac ChIP-Seq full dataset from HeLa-S3 cells.

It starts with the aligned BED files which we provide here. Those files were generated by aligning reads to hg19 using Bowtie2, followed by PCR duplicates removal using SAMtools. 


*Step 1:* Download the `H3K27ac` ChIP-Seq BED files corresponding to Replicate 1, Replicate 2 and ChIP Input (Warning: Files are big, up to about 4Gb). 

* [Replicate 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8nxBVNVchN9c2lQQmZBSXZwQWM/edit?usp=sharing)
 
* [Replicate 2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8nxBVNVchN9OUlPQlQwNDRyWkU/edit?usp=sharing)

* [ChIP HeLa-S3 Broad Institute Input](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8nxBVNVchN9WHpXRTdpY29hNDQ/edit?usp=sharing)

*Step 2:* Download the chromosome size file corresponding to hg19 genome build. This file is needed by JAMM to run.

* [hg19 chromosome size file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8nxBVNVchN9SGNsQXlrQTg3UTA/edit?usp=sharing)


*Step 3:* Create the directory structure you need to run JAMM. We recommend you set up a main directory called "`H3K27ac`" and 2 additional sub-directories called "sample" and "control":

{{{
mkdir H3K27ac

mkdir H3K27ac/sample

mkdir H3K27ac/ctrl
}}}

*Step 4:* Copy the Replicate 1 and Replicate 2 BED files to the "`H3K27ac`/sample" directory. Copy the Input file to the "`H2K27ac`/ctrl" directory.

*Step 5:* Copy the chromosome size file to the "`H3K27ac`" directory.

*Step 6:* You are now ready to run JAMM:

{{{
bash /path/to/JAMM/folder/JAMM.sh -s /path/to/your/"H3K27ac/sample"/folder -g /path/to/your/chromosome/size/file -o /path/to/folder/with/your/main/"H3K27ac"/folder -c /path/to/folder/with/your/"H3K27ac/ctrl"/folder
}}}

*Step 7*: Check the output. You will have two new folders in your main "`H3K27ac`" directory. One is called "peaks" containing your peak files and one is called "xcorr" containing results for cross-correlation analysis.

*We already analyzed this dataset using JAMMv1.0.4 and you can get [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8nxBVNVchN9c01KNFBXMm5VeFE/edit?usp=sharing our results here] (Provided just as an example, not to be used directly in publications).*
