JAMM was developed in the Ohler lab at the Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology.

Important Note: JAMM produces a large number of peaks on purpose to allow you to choose your threshold the way you like. The peaks are scored and ranked by column 7  in the output narrowPeak file. If you want a confident list directly from JAMM, you could use the option "-e auto", although a better way is probably to see the peaks that are reproducible in your replicates.
